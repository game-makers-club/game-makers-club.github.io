    <h2> Pico-8 Basic Game </h2>
    <p>We are going to use a "fantasy game console" called Pico-8, which is
      available to purchase from <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/" title="Pico-8"

        target="_blank">https://www.lexaloffle.com/</a>. If you want to work
      fast, on a simple game, here is one simple page tutorial on 
      Pico-8 to make a space shooter:

    <p>We'll start off more slowly, with creating a basic sprite, and allow some simple
      animation.</p>
    <img src="sprite.png" alt="simple sprite" title="Simple Sprite" height="300">
    <p>Fig 1: Simple Sprite - sprite 0</p>
    <p>However, every game requires a data representation of the player; this
      can be as simple as its X and Y coordinates on screen, but will often
      include other things too. For now we need a representation of which sprite
      to show. Our game loop will require an _INIT function to create and set up
      this data, in this case, a table or object, called PLAYER. _INIT is only
      run once, at the start of the game.</p>

      height="200">
    <p>Fig 2: Simple Sprite - data representation in _INIT</p>
    <p> Next in our game loop, we need an _UPDATE function, which runs once a
      tick in game time; for Pico-8 and many older game engines, this is thirty
      times a second. For more recent game engines, sixty or even 120 ticks per
      second are possible. Here, we are detecting the arrow keys being pressed,
      and updating the X and Y values for our player sprite; X+=1 is short hand
      for adding one to X (equivalent to X=X+1) </p>

    <p>Fig 3: Simple Sprite - basic movement in X and Y direction</p>
    <p>However, this means that we can walk our player off the screen! Values
      less than 0 or greater than 127 would have the player partly, or
      completely off the screen; the X and Y values are usually for the top left
      corner of the sprite, so we can go down to -8 before the sprite is off
      screen at the top or the left, and over 127 for bottom and right. So, we
      must make sure that our character wraps for now. Wrapping means that the
      player moving off the top, comes on at the bottom, and left and right are
      linked too. (Clearly, there are other options, such as keeping the player
      on screen.) </p>

    <p>Finally, we need a _DRAW function, which will also be run so many times a
      second; in the case of Pico-8 this is also 30 times a second, but screen
      refresh rates can vary, depending on different engines, and the complexity
      of what is on screen. You may have heard of "locked at 60 fps", which is
      guaranteeing that the screen refresh rate is 60Hz, where fps stands for
      "frames per second". However, games often have to slow down refresh rates,
      when there is a lot going on. For flicker-free gaming, we need a minimum
      of 30-60fps, but we can often see variation as worse than a consistent
      lower refresh rate. Pico-8 works with 30fps, but VR games often need
      90-120fps to stop us from feeling sick or nauseous! </p>

    <p>Fig 5: Simple Sprite - drawing the sprite on screen</p>
    <p>Here, the CLS function clears the screen each frame - CLS stands for
      CLear Screen - and SPR prints a sprite at X and Y, where (0,0) is the top
      left of the screen; bottom right is (127,127) BTW (by the way), and SPR is
      short for SPRite. PLAYER.SPRITE was set in the INIT function to be 0, so
      the first sprite is what is put on screen. However, it would be nice to
      change this each frame, so that our player character can walk. </p>
    <p>So, we should create a series of sprites that show a walk cycle, by
      cutting and pasting, and editing the image to show a basic walk animation.
      Here, sprite 0 is our "stand still" sprite, while the following six
      sprites show us lifting and dropping our feet, in a cycle. (A little tip:
      as well as cutting and pasting sprites, we can use 'f' and 'v' to flip
      sprites in the editor horizontally and vertically, respectively. This will
      save time. The game can flip sprites during execution too, so we can reuse
      sprites as well, but more of that later. </p>

    <p>Fig 1a: Crude animation - sprites 0 to 7</p>
    <p>For this to work, we need a flag to tell the game when we are moving, so
      we know to keep changing the sprite. Here we have added PLAYER.MOVE to the
      Player object, which is either TRUE or FALSE. </p>
    <img src="crude-anim1a.png" alt="crude animation" title="Crude animation" height="250">
    <p>Fig 1a: Crude animation - move flag</p>
    <p>If we detect a button press, then we set this to be TRUE. If there is no
      button pressed, we set it to FALSE. (Here we only show one of the IF
      statements.)</p>

      height="200">
    <p>Fig 1b: Crude animation - setting the move flag</p>
    <p>Now we need to cycle the sprite value between 1 and 7, to make our player
      walk, and we need to reset to 1 when we go over 7. Also, when we stop, we
      need to set our 'idle' state, which is sprite 0, or stand still sprite. </p>

    <p>Fig 1a: Crude animation - using the move flag to update our sprite images</p>
    <p>However, this is very wasteful, as we have had to recreate several of the
      sprites to allow for smooth animation. We can do better! To do this, we
      use another table, this time to reference specific sprites, to save us
      some work. Instead of seven sprites, nearly half of which are duplicates,
      we can use four instead. </p>
